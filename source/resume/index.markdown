The languages I am currently most fluent in are **Python** and **Javascript**,
although I have done work with Java and C#, and would *love* to
work with **node.js**, **Ruby**, or **Elixir** and **Erlang**.

I am most comfortable with agile development processes and enjoy
pair-programming and practicing TDD and BDD
