    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just published my first public project &ndash; <a href="http://github.com/craigbeck/generator-pymod">generator-pymod</a>. It is a super-simple <a href="http://yeoman.io/generators.html">Yeoman generator</a> that creates a couple of files and a directory in the form of a Python module. As I said, simple. It&rsquo;s not much to do by hand, but I <em>hate</em> doing things over and over that a script would be better at doing for me, and I <em>hate</em> having to remember minutiae.</p>

<p>So I decided to automate this using Yeoman. I know I could have done this with a simple bash script (actually I did), but I wanted to learn how to put together a very simple generator by actually doing it. The end result  is that I learned a thing or two about yeoman, but more importantly my eyes were opened to how easy things like <a href="http://npmjs.org">npm</a> make it to <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/generator-pymod">publish my first npm package</a>.</p>

<p>It reminded me of <a href="http://codinghorror.com">Jeff Atwood&rsquo;s</a> article <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/08/falling-into-the-pit-of-success.html">&ldquo;Falling into the Pit of Success&rdquo;</a>. It was just <em>so easy</em> to publish it: why woudn&rsquo;t I? After the initial push <a href="https://github.com/craigbeck/generator-pymod">to github</a> it was all of 2 minutes looking at the docs before I was &ldquo;live&rdquo; at the <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/generator-pymod">npm package registry</a>. A few more minutes and I had it running on Travis continuous integration on <a href="https://travis-ci.org/craigbeck/generator-pymod">travis-ci.org</a>.</p>
